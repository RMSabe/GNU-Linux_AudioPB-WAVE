Wave Audio File Playback Application for GNU-Linux Systems.
Version 2.0

Supported formats are mono and stereo, 16bit and 24bit. Sample rate compatibility depends on your audio hardware.

When compiling, one resource must be explicitly linked: -lasound

v2.0 Update:
The code structure has been redesigned and it's now more object-oriented. The whole code generates a single executable now.
