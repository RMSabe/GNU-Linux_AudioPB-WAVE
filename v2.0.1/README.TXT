Wave Audio File Playback Application for GNU-Linux Systems.
Version 2.0.1

Supported formats are mono and stereo, 16bit and 24bit. Sample rate compatibility depends on your audio hardware.

When compiling, one resource must be explicitly linked: -lasound

v2.0.1 Update:
Some refactoring and optimization on top of v2.0. Many methods and properties that were repeated on the children AudioPlayback classes have been moved to the parent AudioPlayback class.
